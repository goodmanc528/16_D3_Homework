          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h4>Observation 1 - Poverty</h4>
          <p>The plotted information tells us that there is a positive linear correllation between the Poverty rate of a state and 
            the three values on the X-Axis: Lacking Healthcare, Obesity Rate, Smoker Rate.  This fairly alarming as those who seem
            at greater risk for health problems (overweight and/or smokers) are not receiving the proper healthcare and very likely
            do not have the means to pursure it themselves.</p>
          
          <h4>Observation 2 - Income</h4>
          <p>Look at the Median income we can see that there is a very loose negative linear correlation, at best, between Income and
            having sufficient healthcare.  At the reported income levels over 80% of the residents in 49 (counting Washington DC) of
            states/districts have sufficient healthcare.   Looking at obesity and smoker rate we see a stronger negative correltation
            between Income and Obesity and Smoker Rate.  As a state's average income decreases they may see and increase in the number
            of smokers as well as an increase the number of obese residents.</p>
